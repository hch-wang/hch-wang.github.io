I am a PhD student at [Soft Matter Group, DAMTP, Cambridge University](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/softmatter/index).
conducting my research under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Cates](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/mec22) and [Dr. Ronojoy Adhikari](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ra413).
Before I start my PhD, I had the honor of working under [Prof. Darry Holm](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~dholm/) at Imperial College London.
During my study, I was privileged to be advised by
[Prof. Boris Khesin](http://www.math.toronto.edu/khesin/) at University of Toronto, 
and
[Dr. Thibault Bertrand](https://thibaultbertrand.com/) at Imperial College London.

My interests are mainly in mathematics physics, nonlinear physics, complex system, and machine learning.
I am particularly interested in various emergent phenomena and nonlinear dynamics.
I am also a enthusiast of the philosophy of science, math and physics.
Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the safety risks posed by the hype, abuse, blind faith, and dogmatic approaches surrounding machine learning.
